| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1. soft-test | Python | testing algorithms | complete info: postition, borders, no transfer lag |
| 2. hard-test | Python, C++, ROS | other programs are 'safe' | algorithms that are not being tested will be set to 'safe' outputs |
| 3. master | Python, C++, ROS | final testing | no assumed information |
